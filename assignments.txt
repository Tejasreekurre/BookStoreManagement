1) roots of quadratic equation
2) accept marks in 3 subjects of a student. calculate the grade as per the
    following conditions.

    m1          m2          m3

    each subject must have >= 35 marks
    if average is more than 70, grade is "E"
    if average is >= 60 but < 70, grade is "A"
    if average is >= 50 but < 60, grade is "B"
    if average is >= 35 but < 50, grade is "C"
    otherwise "F"

3) accept a number. check whether it is palindrome or not.
    eg: input : 121
        output : palindrome
4) accept a number. check whether it is armstrong or not.
    eg: input : 153
        3 * 3 * 3 = 27
        5 * 5 * 5 = 125
        1 * 1 * 1 = 1
                    -----
                    153
                    -----
        output: armstrong
5) accept a number. check whether it is strong number or not.
    eg: input : 145

        5! = 120
        4! = 24
        1! = 1
            ------
            145
            ------
        output : strong
6) accept a number. print the digits in words.
    eg: input : 648
        output : SIX FOUR EIGHT
7) accept two numbers. check whether they are amicable numbers or not.
    num1 = factors sum start from 1 exclude num1 = result1
    num2 = factors sum start from 1 exclude num2 = result2

    if result2 == num1 and result1 == num2 then they are amicable.
8) accept a number. print whether it is UNIQUE number or not.
    eg: input : 1089

            1089
        x      9   (unit digit)
        ----------------------
            9801
        ----------------------

        output : unique
9) accept two numbers. print the LCM and GCD.
10) print the following floyd triangle upto n rows.
        *   *   *   *
        *   *   *
        *   *
        *
11) print the following floyd triangle upto n rows.
        1
        0   1
        1   0   1
        0   1   0   1
12) print the following pyramid upto n rows.
                    1
                1   2   1
            1   2   3   2   1
        1   2   3   4   3   2   1

13) labelled break statement.
    write an example program using this.

14) what is the difference between for loop and enhanced for loop?

===========
15) binary search
16) bubble sort

17) matrix addition
18) matrix multiplication
19) matrix transpose
20) accept two matrices. check whether they are equal or not.
21) accept a matrix. check whether it is symmetric matrix or not. (A = transpose of A)
22) accept a matrix. print the sum of principle diagonal elements, upper triangular elements
    and lower triangular elements.
23) accept a matrix. check whether it is identity matrix or not.
24) accept a matrix. print whether it is orthogonal matrix or not. ( A x transpose of A = I)

25) write a function to calculate factorial of a given number,
 and another function to calculate the exponential value when base and exponent.
use these function to find the sum of the following series ...

x + (x^2 / 2!) + (x^3 / 3!) + (x^4/4!) + .... + (x^n/n!) = ?

you are not allowed to use any library methods.

26) write a function return sum, average, min, max of an array passed as an argument.

27) use function overloading.
        array_copy(int[] dest, int[] src) : to copy all elements from src to dest.
        array_copy(int[] dest, int[] src, int num) : to copy num elements from src to dest.

28) write a recursive function to find the max element in the array.
