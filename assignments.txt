Points to be noted
-------------------
1. All these assignments must be done in a separate project in the same workspace
name it as "Assignments".
2. Proper Naming Conventions
3. Proper Indentation
4. Execution

    each subject must have >= 35 marks
    if average is more than 70, grade is "E"
    if average is >= 60 but < 70, grade is "A"
    if average is >= 50 but < 60, grade is "B"

b) Should be able to remove an event
c) List all the events in the ascending order of dateScheduled
d) List all the events in the alphabetical order of location
