What is Java?
    is a high level strictly but partially object oriented progrmming.

    + Strictly object oriented, as there is no way possible to implement any java application 
      without using OOP.,
    + Partially object oriented, as java supports native variables and native types which are
      not objects and classes

Who developed Java?
    Sun microsystems - James Gosling
    Oracle corp. is the present owner of Java language.

        Java Micro Edition
        ==================================

                supports smart device / smart card based application development.

C/C++ program execution process:
---------------------------------
text editor     -   source program  -                   sample.c / sample.cpp
compiler        -   object program  -                   sample.obj / sample.o
                    (intermeditate program)
linker          -   header files (.h)   -               sample.exe 
                    all the header files are linked 
                    to the object program and create
                    an executable program.
loader          -   to supply the executable code to
                    the  O/S for execution.

C/C++ languages are platform dependent languages. (here platform means o/s)

Java program excution process:
------------------------------
text editor             -   source code     -   sample.java
compiler   (javac)      -   byte code       -   sample.class   
                    (byte code is not in the form of 0's & 1's)

is this sample.class is targeted to one particular O/S ?
NO.

sample.class is not an executable program.

byte code   --> JVM (Java Virtual Machine) -> JVM will convert the byte code 
        into native machine code (sequence of 0's & 1's understood by that particular
        O/S in which the program is executed)
        the program is executed.

        machine code is generated ON-THE-FLY.

Java is platform (means o/s) independent language.

is JDK  common for all O/S? -   (platform dependent)
    NO
is JRE  common for all O/S? -   (platform dependent)
    No
is JVM  common for all O/S? -   (platform dependent)
    NO

BYTE CODE is the only one component which is platform independent.

is Native machine code common for all O/S?
    NO

JDK   (Java Development Kit)  
    for developers.
    lot of tools to develop java applications.
    
    javac   -   java compiler
    java    -   interpreter
    javadoc -   to create HTML documentation of a project
    javap
    jdb     -   java debugger
    appletviewer

JRE   (Java Runtime Environment)
    JRE provide JVM + other libraries

Features of Java:
-----------------
1. platform independent
2. object oriented 
3. secured
        no explicit pointers in java.
        java programs run inside a special environment i.e. JVM.
        JVM will talk to O/S.
        (JVM is a collection of programs - class-loader, byte-code-verifier, garbage-collector)
4. robust
        means fault-tolerant, strong, vigour and healthy.
        a. exception handling
        b. automatic garbage collection
        c. strong type checking.
5. self-documented (open source)
    source code is visible to anyone.
6. architectural neutral
7. compiled and interpreted



CODING STANDARDS / BEST PRACTICES
1. maintain proper indentation.
2. naming conventions



                            Java Tokens
                            -----------
smallest element in the program.

1. identifier
        it is a name given to variables, class, method names, package etc.,

        variable, method names must follow camel notation 
            first word is in lowercase.
            from the second word onwards use first letter of each word is in uppercase
            and rest in lower case.

            eg:
                length
                lengthOfRectangle
                circleArea

                acceptData()
                showMinMaxInArray()
        
        class names, file name and project must follow pascal notation.
        (first letter of each word in uppercase and the rest in lowercase).
            eg:
                ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
                RuntimeException
                String

        package name
            always in lowercase
            there are often abbreviated.
            eg:
                io

            always be in uppercase.
            it is a name given to literal.
            it is immutable.
            it is qualified with "final" keyword.
            they can be separated with an underscore.

            final double PIE = 3.14;
                    PIE is a constant.
                    3.14 is literal

            final int PASS_MARKS = 35;
            final int MAX_MARKS = 100;
            final int BATCH_CAPACITY = 40;
            
            double circumference = 2 * PIE * radius;

            keyword         double
            indentifier     circumference
            operator        =
            literal         2
            operator        *
            constant        PIE
            operator        *
            identifier      radius
            operator        ;


2. keywords
        these are also reserved words.
        eg: if, switch, for, while
            int, float, double

3. operators

        binary operators
            it takes two operands
            all the remaining 
        ternary operator
            which takes three operands.
            conditional operator

Eclipse IDE:
------------
    1. change the perspective to "Java Perspective"
        (window -> perspective -> open perspective)
    2. change the Installed JRE : JDK1.8
        (windows -> preferences -> java -> installed jre)

    3. Create a java project : ToStartWith
        choose "default JRE as jdk1.8 ..." radio button

    Workspace, project are nothing folders in the o/s.


Package
------------
	It is a collection of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
	If a class is not part of any package, it is automatically placed in "default package".
	purpose of a package is to solve name conflicts. 	
    if two or more classes share the same name, they cannot be part of the same package 
    as it leads to ambiguity.
    package is represented as a folder in O/S.

	if the class inside a package is public, we can make use of the class outside the package.

	whenever we have a public class, then the class name and file name must be the same.

	A single file can have only one public class. It can have any no. of non-public classes inside a single file.
	
	Name of the package is the reverse order of the web domain of the company.

                        [break;]
        ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..
        default:        st-1;

                        [break;]
    }


How do you accept data from the user?
--------------------------------------
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

    nextInt()
    nextDouble()
    next()
    nextLine()

    Scanner class is available in java.util package.

    import java.util.Scanner;

    (or)

    type the fully qualified name.
    java.util.Scanner scan = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);



2) accept a day number. print the corresponding week day name.

0 - sunday
1 - monday
2 - tuesday

6  - saturday
invalid day number.

    System.in   refer to standard input device i.e., keyboard
    System.out  refer to standard output device i.e., VDU   (monitor)


class Test {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        double height = 153.5;

        switch (height) {
            case 150 : System.out.println("Not accepted");
                       break;
            case 153 : System.out.println("considered");
                       break;
            case 153.5 : System.out.println("selected");
                        break;
        }
    }
}

switch will allow only certain datatypes.
1) byte, short, int, char, String, enum.
2) long, double, float, boolean are not allowed.

byte : 1 bytes
-128 to 127

byte b = 100;
int a = b;          // allowed.

3) accept two numbers and an arithmetic operator. perform the operation and print the result.

    10
    5
    /
    result : 2

15 minutes.


4) accept consumer number, last month reading, current month reading.
    calculate the electricity bill as per the following way ...

    no. of units                slab rate
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
        <= 100                  2.50 per unit
        
        > 100                   for first 100 units, 2.50 per unit
        <= 200                  next remaining units 3.00 per unit

        > 200                   for first 100 units, 2.50 per unit
                                for next 100 units, 3.00 per unit
                                for all remaining units, 3.50 per unit

    add Rs. 50 as fixed charges for each bill.

    print relevant details.

    20 minutes.

    jan 1       :   150  meter reading
    feb 1       :   250 meter reading

    feb bill : 250 - 150 = 100 units

8) write a program to accept numbers continuously till 0 is entered. findout the sum, average
of all these numbers.

int / int = int

10 / 2 = 5
10 / 3 = 3  

int / double = double

double / double  = double

10.0 / 3    =   3.3
10 / 3.0    =   3.3
10.0 / 3.0  =   3.3

type casting:
-------------
changing value from one type to other temporarily.
syntax:
-------
(datatype) var;

(double) sum / count
sum / (double) count


while:
------
    statements are executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
    this is called as entry-tested or top-tested loop.

syntax:
-------
    while (condition) {
        st-1;
        st-2;
        ....
        [break;]

        }
        
        System.out.println("Factorial : " + fact);
        scan.close();
    }
}

how can i choose between for & while?
-------------------------------------
    for loop should be used when you want to execute statement for a finite number of times.
    while loop should be used when you want to execute statements for in indefinite number of
    times.

write a program to enter numbers continuously until user press 0. findout the biggest
and smallest value among them.

10 mins.

for(;;) {

}

while(true) {

}

do .. while:
------------
statements are executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
this is called as exit-tested or bottom-tested loop.

do {
    st-1;
    st-2;
    ...
    [break;]
} while (condition);

it is generally used to write menu-driven programs.

what is the difference between break and continue?
--------------------------------------------------
whenever a break statement is encountered the control immediately comes out of the loop
without executing the remaining iterations.
whereas the continue statement will take you to the next iteration without executing the
remaining statements in the current iteration.


                                            arrays
                                            ======
linear collection of homogeneous data items stored under single name.
0 based index.
every array in java is an object.
array is provide a special property (field) with the name "length", that return no. of cells
in the memory.

if we try to access an element with an invalid index, leads to an exception.
"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException"

types of arrays:
-----------------
1) single dimension
2) multi-dimension
3) jagged 

single dimension:
-------------------
declaring:
----------
    datatype [] arrayName;
    (or)
    datatype arrayName[];

    just by declaring, no memory is allocated.

eg:
    int [] arr;

allocating memory:
------------------
    arrayName = new datatype[size];
eg:
    arr = new int[5];

    whenever we use "new" keyword, the memory is allocated dynamically and stored in a special
    memory area known as "heap".

declaring and allocating :
----------------------------
    datatype [] arrayName = new datatype[size];

eg:
    int [] arr = new int[5];

initialize an array:
---------------------
    int []  arr = {10,20,30,40,50}; 
    

class ArrayExample {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int [] arr = new int[5];

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(arr[i]);
        }
    }
}

int     -   default value   -   0
double  -                   -   0.0
String  -                   -   null
boolean -                   -   false


write a program to find min, max of an array.

enhanced for loop:
------------------
    there is no concept called "index".
	Enhanced for loop offer better performance than classic for loop.
	loop variable is not "int" unlike as in classic for loop.
	type of the loop variable is same as the type of array.
	We cannot process few elements in the array.

    it is used to traverse an entire array or a collection in forward-only direction.

    syntax:
    -------
        for(datatype variable : arrayName) {
            ...
        }

write a program to find number of ZEROs, EVENs and ODDs in an array.

double dimension array:
-----------------------

            studentData
rollno      age     height      weight
1           ..      ..          ...

how do you declare?
    int [][] studentData = new int[3][4];

initialize?

    int [][] studentData = {
        {1, 25, 150, 60},
        {2, 21, 160, 45},
        {3, 19, 140, 36}
    };

every row in a double dimension array is treated as a single dimension array.

the "length" property of a double dimension array, always return no. of rows.
eg:
    studentData.length => 3
    studentData[0].length => 4
    studentData[1].length => 4
    studentData[2].length => 4

Jagged array:
-------------
It is also a double dimension array, where each row contain different number of columns.

eg:
    1   2
    3   4   5
    6   7   8   9
    10

int [][] jarr = {
    {1,2},
    {3,4,5},
    {6,7,8,9},
    {10}
}

                                        Command Line Arguments
                                        ----------------------

public static void main(String [] args) {

}

we cannot define main method like this ..
public static void main() {

}
it is treated as another method.


command line arguments are used to give inputs (parameters) to the main() method.
it is another way of accepting data.

write a program to print all command-line arguments.

write a program to accept two numbers and an arithmetic operation (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)
using command line arguments and perform the operation and print the result.

is int a primitive type ?	
		yes`
is String a primitive type?
		no
		String is a pre-defined class, it is a user-defined type.

How do you convert data of String to primitive type int?
    Integer -> parseInt(String form int)
    eg: 
        "10"    =>  Integer.parseInt("10") => 10
        "5"     =>  Integer.parseInt("5") => 5
        "ADD"   =>  

    Double.parseDouble(String form double)

        "10.5"  =>  Double.parseDouble("10.5") => 10.5
    
    for all illegal value, we get NumberFormatException.

Defensive programming:
----------------------
    avoid run-time errors using our logic.


                                            Functions
                                            =========

It is a sub program designed to perform a specific task that can be used repeatedly.
A function can have 0 or more inputs (arguments / parameters)
But a function can return 0 or 1 value only.

In java, we call functions as "methods".

Function components:
-----------------------
Function declaration    (function prototype)
Function definition     (function code)
Function call

Note:
In order to call a function in the main(), we should declare the function as static.
(or)
Create an object of the class, and access through the object.

formal parameters (formal arguments):
    paraameters given in the function definition.
actual parameters (actual arguments):
    parameters given in the function call.

function calling:
-----------------
1) call-by-value    (sending values)
        for all primitive types, the default mechanism is "call-by-value".
2) call-by-reference (seding references)
        for all objects, the default mechanism is "call-by-reference".


    x = 10       (x)   --->     fn()    --> x++
    x = 10        <------------------------------   call-by-value       
    x = 11        <------------------------------   call-by-reference

can you send array as parameter to function?
yes

can we return array from a function?
yes

write a function to return the reversed array of a given array.
(or)
write a function to accept an array and reverse the array itself and return the reveresed array.


    static void show(int x, double y, String z) {
        System.out.println(x + "\t" + y + "\t" + z);
    }

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        show(5, 10.5, "Java");
        show(5, 10.5);
        show(5);
        show();
    }

actual parameters (3)           formal parameters (3)
actual parameters (2)
actual parameters (1)
actual parameters (0)

rule:
-----
    no. of actual parameters = no. of formal parameters


        sum of few numbers.


        sum(10,20)      ==> 30
        sum(1,2,3,4,5)  ==> 15
        sum(3)          ==> 3

        int sum(int [] arr) {

        }


                                            VarArgs
                                            -------
Variable Arguments
    it represents indefinite number of arguments
    it is represented with ... (three dots)
    three dot symbol "ellipsis".

    we can pass any number of arguments while calling this type of function.

    Command Line Arguments can also be represeted as Variable Arguments.



                                        Function Overloading
                                        ---------------------
when two or more functions are having the same name but with different set of parameters ,
the it is said to be function overloading.

int area(int a, int b) {

}

int area(int a, double b) {

}       // allowed

int area(double a, int b) {

}   // allowed

double area(int a, int b) {

}   // NOT ALLOWED - return type is not considered


                                        Recursion
                                        ----------
calling the same function being in itself.

            int factorial(int  num) {
                if (num == 0) {
                    return 1;
                } else {
                    return num*factorial(num-1);
                }
            }

    System.out.println(arr1);       // values are not displayed. reference is displayed.
    System.out.println(arr2);

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        arr1[i]++;
    }

    for(int val : arr1) {
        System.out.println(val);
    }                               // 11,21,31,41,51

    for(int val : arr2) {
        System.out.println(val);    // 11,21,31,41,51
    }


Arrays class: (java.util package)
----------------------------------
provide many util methods to simplify our programming.
explore these methods.

1) copyOf()
2) binarySearch()
3) sort()
4) fill()

whenever we == on arrays to check for equality, references are compared, not data.

5) equals()
6) deepEquals()


                                OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)
                                =========================================
It is a programming paradigm.

1) monolithic   : Assembly language
2) procedure oriented   :   COBOL
3) structured   :   'C'
4) object oriented 
    +   data is given more importance than logic
    +   object contain it's own data and related operations

    actor

class   :  it is a user-defined datatype that represent an entity in terms of properties
           (variables / fields / data members) and behaviours (methods).
           it is a re-usable software component.

           classes we are going to create also called as models, pojos, beans etc.,
           POJO (plain old java object)

object  :  it is the entity itself.

Employee
    id
    name
    dateJoined
    salary

state:
    whenever an operation is done on the object, properties will change. this is called 
    state is modified.

Account
    id : 101            name : srinivas         balance : 10000     (current statement)

            operation (deposit - 5000)

                                                balance : 15000     (new state)

datatype    <---    value
int = 50;

datatype    <--     variable    <-- value

Employee    <--     object         <--  data


define a class:
-----------------
class   ClassName {
    datatype dataMember1;
    returnType method1() {

    }
    returnType method2() {

    }
}

No memory is allocated when we define a class.

declare an object:
------------------
className   objectName = new className();

the "new" keyword allocate memory for an object.

features:
---------
1) Encapsulation
        nothing but data hiding.
        providing setters (mutators) and getters (accessors) to access private data members
        to other classes.
        setters are used to provide initial value or to modify existing value of a data member.
        getters are used to retrieve current value of data members.


2) Abstraction
        nothing but behaviour hiding.
3) Data hiding:
        make data members as private.
        so that they are not accessible from outside of the class.
        

ComplexNumber
    realPart
    imaginaryPart

Access Specifiers (Access modifiers)
-------------------------------------
1) default : which is taken when no specific access is given on members.
    any member under default can be accessed only in the current package.
2) private : members under this access can be used only within the class in which they
             are declared.
3) public  : members under this access can be used everywhere, wherever the package is visible.
4) protected : members under this access can be used either within the class or any of it's
             sub class.

"this" reference:
-----------------
it refer to "implied object".
implied object is the object is the one, on which the current method is called.

Constructor
---------------
It is a special method which is automatically executed whenever an object is created.
It is used to initialize data members.
It should have same name as that of class.
A class can have many constructors. this feature is called "constructor overloading".
It cannot return any value, and should not be marked as void.

this() is also used to call a constructor from another constructor of the same class.   

public class Test {

	public Test() {
		this("hello, how are you?");
		System.out.println("default constructor");

	}
	
	public Test(String msg) {
		System.out.println(msg);
	}
	
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		Test t = new Test();
	}

}

if no constructor is defined, java itself insert a default constructor to the class internally.
if at all you write atleast one constructor, java will not insert any constructor.

types of contructors:
-----------------------
1) default constructors     (no-parameter constructor)
2) parameter constructor    (parameterized / parametric constructor)
3) copy constructor:
    it takes object of the same class as parameter.
    it is automatically executed whenever we are creating a new object by passing an
    existing object as a parameter.

class  Student {
    private int rollNumber;
    private String name;
    private static int feePaid;

    public Student(int rollNumber, String name) {       // parameter constructor
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
        this.name = name;
    }

    /* setters are getters */
}

class StundentApp {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();     // it is expecting default constructor
        System.out.println(s1.getRollNumber() + "\t" + s1.getName());
    }
}

since the above class do not have a default constructor, we can create object by
    Student s1 = new Stundent();

Student s2 = new Student(2, "deepa");  // perfectly valid

include the default constructor.

    public Student() {
        /* intentionally left blank */
    }


"static" keyword:
-----------------

It can be used in different ways.
a) static data members	(when a data member is declared with "static" keyword)
b) static methods		(when a  method is defined with "static" keyword)
c) static block		(block means a group of statements enclosed within curly braces)
d) static class		(when a  class is defined with "static" keyword - inner class)


static data members:
---------------------
	data member that is declared with "static keyword" is also called "class variables".
	data members that are declared "without static", are called "instance variables".
	every object of a class have independent copies of instance variables (data members) 
    and they all share the same copy of class variable.
    it is used to store common data of all objects of the class.

static methods:
---------------
	a static method can make use of other static members (data members or methods) directly.
	"this" keyword cannot be used in static method.
	
    we can call a static method directly with the class name, not with any object.

    className.staticMethodName();

    class           methods
                    --------
    Scanner         nextInt()
                    nextDouble()

    create an object for the Scanner class
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

    objectName.methodName()

    scan.nextInt();

    class           static method
    ------          -------------
    Integer         parseInt()
    Double          parseDouble()

            Integer.parseInt()
            Double.parseDouble()

    Math            pow()
                    sqrt()
                    PI          // static data member (or) static field

                    Math.PI
                    Math.sqrt()
                    Math.pow()
                    Math.abs()


	PUBLIC STATIC members of a class can be accessed directly with class name. 
    we do not need to have any object.

static block:
---------------
	static {
		st-1;
		st-2;
		......
	}

	a class can have only one static block.
	static block gets executed whenever the class is accessed for the first time.
	a class is said to be accessed if ....
	i) memory for an object is allocated for it.	(new keyword)
	ii) one of its static members are accessed.
	iii) any of i) ii)  happens on any subclass of the current class.

polymorphism:
-------------------
	poly means "many".
	morph means "forms"

	It is a behaviour of an entity.
	different behaviours with the same name.

	class	Human {

		public Energy eat(IceCream  ic) {
			Energy energy = 0;
			while (ic is still left) {
				energy += lick(ic);
			}	
			return energy;
		}
		
		public Energy eat(Apple  apple) {
			Energy energy = 0;
			while (apple is still left) {
				energy += chewAndSwallow(apple);
			}	
			return energy;
		}
	}

	eat() is exhibiting polymorphism.


	class	ArithmeticOperation {
		multiply(int a, int b)  {
			return a*b;
		}
		multiply(Complex a, Complex b) {
			// different code
		}
		multiply(Matrix a, Matrix b) {
			// different code
		}
		multiply(Polynomial a, Polynomial b) {
			// different code
		}	
	}

	multiply() is exhibiting polymorphism.

	overloading:  (compile-time polymorphism or early-binding)
	-----------------------------------------------------------
		when two are more methods are said to be overloaded when ....
		i) they must share the same name
		ii) they belong to the same class (or) to a super class and sub class
		iii) they differ in no. of parameters (or) parameter types.

		example: eat(), multiply()
		
	overriding:  (run-time polymorphism or late-binding)
	-----------------------------------------------------
		two methods are said to be overridden when ...
		i) they share the same signature	
		  (signature means method name, return type, argument list)
		ii) they belong to super class and sub class

        we can use @Override annotation to specify that the method is going to be overriding
        the super class method.
        
        the compiler will give an error if the signature is not matching with super class 
        method.



java.lang.Object class:
------------------------------
	Every class in java whether is pre-defined or user-defined, inherited from java.lang.Object 
    class.
	It is called "universal super class" (cosmic class)

	methods of java.lang.Object class:
	---------------------------------------------
	1) public String toString()
		it converts an object into String.

	the default implementation is to return the hashcode.
	System.out.println(object)	: display the hashcode in hexa decimal system.
	System.out.println(object.toString()) is same as previous statement.

	But whenever we want to print the object, we want to display properies of an object. 
    In such case, we must override toString() method.

    2) int hashcode()
        it return the hash code in decimal system.

    Stack and Heap memory
    ------------------------
    Student s = new Student();
    variable s ->  in stack memory -> hashcode
    object memory -> in heap memory -> data



Day - 5

Inheritance:

	creating a new class (sub class) from an existing class (super class).
    sub class can make use of all features of super class as well as any extra features that are
    added to it.
    it represent "is-A" relation ship.
    it is mainly for code-reusability.

	types of inheritance:
	----------------------------
	1) simple		2) hierarchical	    3) multi-level  4) multiple	    5) hybrid
	
    the keyword "extends" is used to derive a sub class from a super class.
	java doesn't support multiple inheritance for classes that means a class can have only one
    superclass.
	
    Note:
    ------
	Inheritance will share only the definition but not the existence.



CASE STUDY:
-------------------------------
Person
    name, age
    setters, getters, constructors, toString
Employee    (is a Person)       [simple]
    salary
    setters, getters, constructors, toString
Manager		(is a Employee)		[multi-level]
	allowance
    setters, getters, constructors, toString
	
ContractEmployee	(is also an Employee)			[hierarchical]
	contractDuration

constructor phenomenon:
----------------------------------
	when an object is created, the constructor of that class is called.

	when an object of sub class is created, super class constructor is called first and 
    then the sub class constructor is called. This hold true for any levels of inheritance.

	when a sub class object is created with

	i) default constructor		then the super class default constructor is called.
	ii) parameter constructor	then the super class default constructor is called.
	iii) copy constructor		then the super class default constructor is called.

"super" keyword:	("super" reference)
----------------------------------------------------
	1) it is used to call the constructor of super class from the constructor of sub class.
	2) This is used exclusively call a parameter constructor or copy constructor of the 
        super class from sub class constructor.
	3) if super() has to be used, it must be the first statement in the code block.
	4) this() and super() cannot be used at a time.	(mutually exclusive)
	5) "super" can be used to call an overriding function of super class in the sub class.

class A {
    public A() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }
}
class B extends A {
    public B() {
        System.out.println("B");
    }
    public B(String msg) {
        System.out.println(msg);
    }
    public B(B obj) {
        System.out.println("copy constructor");
    }
}
class C extends B {
    public C() {
        System.out.println("C");
    }
}
class Main {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        B obj2 = new B(obj);
    }
}


Abstract Polymorphism	(Abstraction)
---------------------------------------------------------
abstract means "incomplete or unclear". It is an idea but we don't know how to implement.
abstraction means "behaviour hiding".
abstraction is "disclosing only required details and hiding the background implementation".

abstract class:
--------------------
	It is a class which should not have objects allocated.

	School Automation
		School	=> Domain
		Teacher, Student, Principle	=> Domain Entities
	
		common properties	=>  

		Person ==> name, age, phone, address, date of birth, weght, height, blood group

		Teacher extends Person	    => salary, subject, 
		Principle extends Person	==>	....
		Student extends Person      ==> fee, class, section

        In this scenario, we never need to create an object for Person.
        so, Person class can be declared as an abstract.

	to make a class abstract, it must be defined with an "abstract" keyword.
	we cannot instantiate (create an object) an abstract class.

abstract method:
----------------------
	It is a method which do not have any implementation (i.e., definition)

   	eg:	abstract class Shape 
			abstract 	area()	: 
			abstract 	perimeter() :
			abstract	volume();


	    abstract class	Rectangle	extends	Shape {
			@Override
			area() {
				...
			}
			@Override
			perimeter() {
				..
			}
		}

		class	Cuboid	extends	Rectangle {
			@Override
			volume() {
				....
			}
		}

	1) an abstract method must be written only inside an abstract class.
	2) but an abstract class need not contain an abstract method.
	3) all sub classes of abstract class, must implement (override) all abstract methods. 
       if not, the sub class must also be marked as "abstract".

abstract class A {
    abstract void show();
}

class B extends A {
    @Override
    protected void show() {               
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        B obj = new B();
        obj.show();
    }
}

error:
    cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method.

Visibility Levels:
---------------------------------------------
private             (least visiblity)
default             (it can be used in any class belong to the current package)
protected           (it is visible to current class as wells as in any of
                    sub classes)
public              (every where)
---------------------------------------------

Referencing:
------------

	In inheritance, super class reference variable can hold sub class objects.
	Vice Versa  is NOT TRUE.

			                    Employee
			                        |
            --------------------------------------------
	        |					                        |
         Manager				                ContractEmployee
	        |
       Managing Director

	Employee emp1 = new Employee();		// OK
	Employee emp2 = new Manager();		// OK
	Employee emp3 = new ContractEmployee();	// OK
	Employee emp4 = new ManagingDirector();	// OK
	
	Manager m1 = new Manager();		// OK
	Manager m2 = new ManagingDirector();		// OK
	
	Manager m3 = new ContractEmployee();	// Not OK
	
	ContractEmployee ce = new Employee();	// Not OK


	Type Casting:
	------------------
	Converting one datatype to another.

	2 types.

	a) Narrowing	(demotion)		explicit
	b) Broadening	(promotion)		implicit

	primitve types:
	-------------------
	b) broadening:
	    -----------------
	int x = 45;
	double d = x;		(implicit)	- broadening

	double d2 = 67;		// OK
	int y = '@';		// OK

	char -> int -> double

	a) narrowing: (explicit):
	------------------------------
	int x = 45.0;		// error
	int x = (int)45.0;		// OK

	char ch = (char)156;	// OK

	user-defined datatype types:
	-----------------------------------------

	ContractEmployee ce1 = new Employee();		// Not OK
	ContractEmployee ce2 = emp3;			// Not OK

	ContractEmployee ce2 = (ContractEmployee)emp3	// OK
	
	ContractEmployee ce3 = emp4;			// Not OK
	ContractEmployee ce2 = (ContractEmployee)emp4	// Not OK  - we get ClassCastException

	Manager m1 = (Manager)emp2;			// OK
	Manager m2 = (Manager)emp3;			// Not OK
	Manager m3 = (Manager)emp4;			// OK

	
Dynamic Polymorphism:
--------------------------------
With all abstract functions, there will be multiple implementations. Here the dynamic polymorphism is implemented.

final keyword:
------------------
1) final class : it cannot be inherited.
2) final method : it cannot be overridden.
3) final variable : value of which cannot be modified.

Note:
-------
The abstract and final cannot appear at the same time since  they are mutually exclusive (It is called as “Definition Constradictory”)

Best Practices:
--------------------
whenever we create a constant, it is recommended to mark it as "public static final".
	final because ,it must be a constant.
	static because a constant will have only value for all objects of the class.
	public because however it cannot be modified.

eg:
	public class Circle {
		private double radius;
		public static final double PIE = 3.14;

		/* setters and getters */
	}
